# first-data-analysis
This is my first data analysis project which is a guided project from Coursera: Clean and analyze social media usage data with Python. As well, it's my first repository on GitHub, I'm not familiar with it, but I'll take my time to learn about it and improve my skills.
Addition information you can find on .ipynb files that will be added here as soon as possible.

Hope we can help each other to improve our skills. Thank you for you visit!
